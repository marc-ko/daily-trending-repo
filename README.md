## Become an irreplaceable 10x developer in 30 seconds flat

Why learn actual skills when you can just *look* impressive instead?

Introducing **rust-stakeholder** - a CLI tool that generates absolutely meaningless but impressive-looking terminal output to convince everyone you're a coding genius without writing a single line of useful code.

> "After using rust-stakeholder, I'm no longer asked about my deadlines but rather for my insights during board meetings." - Developer who still hasn't completed their tickets from last sprint

Remember, it's not about your actual contribution to the codebase; it's about how complicated your terminal looks when the VP of Engineering walks by. Nothing says "I'm vital to this company" like 15 progress bars, cryptic error messages you seem unfazed by, and technical jargon nobody understands.

## Features that add zero value but look incredibly important

- 🖥️ **Dazzling development simulations**: Make it look like you're solving CERN-level computing problems when you're actually just refreshing Reddit.
- 🧠 **Meaningless jargon generator**: Impress with phrases like "Implemented non-euclidean topology optimization for multi-dimensional data representation" (no, it doesn't mean anything).
- 📊 **Convincing progress bars**: Nothing says "I'm working" like a progress bar slowly advancing while you're in the break room.
- 🌐 **Fake network activity**: Simulate mission-critical API requests that are actually just your computer talking to itself.
- 🚨 **Artificial crisis mode**: Generate realistic-looking alerts so people think you're heroically averting disasters.
- 👥 **Imaginary team activity**: Pretend your invisible friends are sending you important pull requests.
- 🎮 **Domain chameleon**: Switch between backend, frontend, blockchain, and 7 other domains faster than you can say "full-stack developer."

Anubis [weighs the soul of your connection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_of_souls) using a SHA-256 proof-of-work challenge to protect upstream resources from scraper bots.

## Overview

Installing and using Anubis will likely prevent your website from being indexed by some search engines. This is considered a feature, not a bug. The aggressive behavior of AI scraper bots has necessitated this approach. While Cloudflare is often sufficient for protection, Anubis is an alternative for those who cannot or do not wish to use it.

If you want to try this out, connect to [anubis.techaro.lol](https://anubis.techaro.lol).

## Support

If you encounter any issues while running Anubis, please [open an issue](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/issues/new?template=Blank+issue) and tag it with the Anubis tag. Be sure to include all relevant information for diagnosis.

For live chat support, consider joining the [Patreon](https://patreon.com/cadey) and asking in the Patron Discord in the `#anubis` channel.

We are excited to announce the release of **DAPO**, a fully open-sourced system for large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) with large language models (LLMs). DAPO stands for **D**ecoupled Clip and **D**ynamic s**A**mpling **P**olicy **O**ptimization, which is a novel algorithm designed to achieve state-of-the-art performance in LLM RL tasks.

Through this initiative, we aim to provide the research community and society with practical access to scalable reinforcement learning, fostering innovation and collaboration in this exciting field. Our system builds upon the impressive [verl](https://github.com/volcengine/verl) framework, and we extend our gratitude to the developers for their outstanding work.

## Discussions Welcomed

If you have any questions or comments regarding our paper or the DAPO system, please feel free to open issues on our GitHub repository. We welcome discussions and feedback!

## Key Results

### AIME 2024 Performance

🚀 **DAPO** achieves an impressive score of **50 points** on the AIME 2024 benchmark using the Qwen2.5-32B base model, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art (SoTA) model, DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B, while utilizing 50% fewer training steps.

![Performance Score](img/score.png)

### Metric Supervision during Training

1. **Length Stability and Growth**: The gradual increase in response length promotes exploration, enabling the model to learn complex reasoning behaviors, thus enhancing training stability and performance.
  
2. **Reward Score Stability**: A consistent rise in reward signals indicates that the model is effectively fitting the training distribution, ensuring a robust and stable learning process.

3. **Entropy and Mean Probability Trend**: A controlled increase in entropy, following an initial decrease, maintains a balance between exploration and exploitation, preventing overfitting and promoting sustained model performance.

AbletonMCP connects Ableton Live to Claude AI through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing Claude to directly interact with and control Ableton Live. This integration enables prompt-assisted music production, track creation, and Live session manipulation.

### Join the Community

Give feedback, get inspired, and build on top of the MCP: [Discord](https://discord.gg/SheqY3UW). Made by [Siddharth](https://x.com/sidahuj).

## Features

- **Two-way communication**: Connect Claude AI to Ableton Live through a socket-based server.
- **Track manipulation**: Create, modify, and manipulate MIDI and audio tracks.
- **Instrument and effect selection**: Claude can access and load the right instruments, effects, and sounds from Ableton's library.
- **Clip creation**: Create and edit MIDI clips with notes.
- **Session control**: Start and stop playback, fire clips, and control transport.

## Components

The system consists of two main components:

1. **Ableton Remote Script** (`Ableton_Remote_Script/__init__.py`): A MIDI Remote Script for Ableton Live that creates a socket server to receive and execute commands.
2. **MCP Server** (`server.py`): A Python server that implements the Model Context Protocol and connects to the Ableton Remote Script.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Ableton Live 10 or newer
- Python 3.8 or newer
- [uv package manager](https://astral.sh/uv)

If you're on Mac, please install uv as:
```bash
brew install uv
```

Otherwise, install from [uv's official website](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

⚠️ Do not proceed before installing UV.

### Claude for Desktop Integration

[Follow along with the setup instructions video](https://youtu.be/iJWJqyVuPS8).

1. Go to Claude > Settings > Developer > Edit Config > `claude_desktop_config.json` to include the following:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "AbletonMCP": {
            "command": "uvx",
            "args": [
                "ableton-mcp"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

### Cursor Integration

Run AbletonMCP without installing it permanently through uvx. Go to Cursor Settings > MCP and paste this as a command:

```bash
uvx ableton-mcp
```

⚠️ Only run one instance of the MCP server (either on Cursor or Claude Desktop), not both.

### Installing the Ableton Remote Script

[Follow along with the setup instructions video](https://youtu.be/iJWJqyVuPS8).

1. Download the `AbletonMCP_Remote_Script/__init__.py` file from this repo.

2. Copy the folder to Ableton's MIDI Remote Scripts directory. Different OS and versions have different locations. **One of these should work, you might have to look**:

   **For macOS:**
   - Method 1: Go to Applications > Right-click on Ableton Live app → Show Package Contents → Navigate to:
     `Contents/App-Resources/MIDI Remote Scripts/`
   - Method 2: If it's not there in the first method, use the direct path (replace XX with your version number):
     `/Users/[Username]/Library/Preferences/Ableton/Live XX/User Remote Scripts`
   
   **For Windows:**
   - Method 1:
     `C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Roaming\Ableton\Live x.x.x\Preferences\User Remote Scripts`
   - Method 2:
     `C:\ProgramData\Ableton\Live XX\Resources\MIDI Remote Scripts\`
   - Method 3:
     `C:\Program Files\Ableton\Live XX\Resources\MIDI Remote Scripts\`
   *Note: Replace XX with your Ableton version number (e.g., 10, 11, 12).*

3. Create a folder called 'AbletonMCP' in the Remote Scripts directory and paste the downloaded `__init__.py` file.

4. Launch Ableton Live.

5. Go to Settings/Preferences → Link, Tempo & MIDI.

6. In the Control Surface dropdown, select "AbletonMCP".

7. Set Input and Output to "None".

## Usage

### Starting the Connection

1. Ensure the Ableton Remote Script is loaded in Ableton Live.
2. Make sure the MCP server is configured in Claude Desktop or Cursor.
3. The connection should be established automatically when you interact with Claude.

### Using with Claude

Once the config file has been set on Claude, and the remote script is running in Ableton, you will see a hammer icon with tools for the Ableton MCP.

This repository provides the official implementations of **3D Gaussian Ray Tracing (3DGRT)** and **3D Gaussian Unscented Transform (3DGUT)**. Unlike traditional methods that rely on splatting, 3DGRT performs ray tracing of volumetric Gaussian particles instead. This enables support for distorted cameras with complex, time-dependent effects such as rolling shutters, while also efficiently simulating secondary rays required for rendering phenomena like reflection, refraction, and shadows. However, 3DGRT requires dedicated ray-tracing hardware and remains slower than 3DGS.

To mitigate this limitation, we also propose 3DGUT, which enables support for distorted cameras with complex, time-dependent effects within a rasterization framework, maintaining the efficiency of rasterization methods. By aligning the rendering formulations of 3DGRT and 3DGUT, we introduce a hybrid approach called **3DGRUT**. This technique allows for rendering primary rays via rasterization and secondary rays via ray tracing, combining the strengths of both methods for improved performance and flexibility.

RF-DETR is a real-time, transformer-based object detection model architecture developed by Roboflow and released under the Apache 2.0 license.

RF-DETR is the first real-time model to exceed 60 AP on the [Microsoft COCO benchmark](https://cocodataset.org/#home) alongside competitive performance at base sizes. It also achieves state-of-the-art performance on [RF100-VL](https://github.com/roboflow/rf100-vl), an object detection benchmark that measures model domain adaptability to real-world problems. RF-DETR is comparable in speed to current real-time object detection models.

**RF-DETR is small enough to run on the edge, making it an ideal model for deployments that need both strong accuracy and real-time performance.**

## Results

We validated the performance of RF-DETR on both Microsoft COCO and the RF100-VL benchmarks.

<summary>Benchmark notes</summary>

The "Total Latency" reported here is measured on a T4 GPU using TensorRT10 FP16 (ms/img) and was introduced by LW-DETR. Unlike transformer-based models, YOLO models perform Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) after generating predictions to refine bounding box candidates. While NMS boosts accuracy, it also slightly reduces speed due to the additional computation required, which varies with the number of objects in an image. Notably, many YOLO benchmarks include NMS in accuracy measurements but exclude it from speed metrics. By contrast, our benchmarking—following LW-DETR’s approach—factors in NMS latency to provide a uniform measure of the total time needed to obtain a final result across all models on the same hardware.

| **[fetcher-mcp](https://github.com/jae-jae/fetcher-mcp)** | MCP server for fetch web page content using Playwright headless browser. | TypeScript | # Fetcher MCP

Fetcher MCP is a server designed for fetching web page content using the Playwright headless browser. It is particularly useful for retrieving dynamic content from modern web applications.

## Advantages

- **JavaScript Support**: Unlike traditional web scrapers, Fetcher MCP can execute JavaScript, allowing it to handle dynamic web content effectively.
  
- **Intelligent Content Extraction**: The built-in Readability algorithm extracts the main content from web pages, filtering out ads and other non-essential elements.

- **Flexible Output Format**: Outputs can be in HTML or Markdown, facilitating easy integration with various applications.

- **Parallel Processing**: The `fetch_urls` tool allows for concurrent fetching of multiple URLs, enhancing efficiency.

- **Resource Optimization**: Automatically blocks unnecessary resources (like images and stylesheets) to save bandwidth and improve performance.

- **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging ensure reliable operations even with problematic web pages.

- **Configurable Parameters**: Offers fine control over timeouts, content extraction, and output formatting to cater to different use cases.

## Quick Start

To run Fetcher MCP directly with npx:

```bash
npx -y fetcher-mcp
```

### Debug Mode

To run in debug mode (showing the browser window for debugging):

```bash
npx -y fetcher-mcp --debug
```

## Configuration MCP

To configure the MCP server in Claude Desktop, modify the configuration file located at:

- On MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- On Windows: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

Example configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fetcher": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "fetcher-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Features

### `fetch_url`

- Retrieve web page content from a specified URL using the Playwright headless browser.
- Supports intelligent extraction and conversion to Markdown.
- **Parameters**:
  - `url`: Required URL of the web page.
  - `timeout`: Page loading timeout in milliseconds (default: 30000).
  - `waitUntil`: Navigation completion criteria (options: 'load', 'domcontentloaded', 'networkidle', 'commit'; default: 'load').
  - `extractContent`: Whether to extract main content (default: true).
  - `maxLength`: Maximum length of returned content (default: no limit).
  - `returnHtml`: Return HTML instead of Markdown (default: false).

  - Other parameters are the same as `fetch_url`.

## Tips

### Handling Special Website Scenarios

#### Dealing with Anti-Crawler Mechanisms

- **Complete Loading**: For CAPTCHA or redirects, prompt with:
  ```
  Please wait for the page to fully load
  ```
  
- **Increase Timeout**: For slow-loading sites:
  ```
  Please set the page loading timeout to 60 seconds
  ```

#### Content Retrieval Adjustments

- **Preserve Original HTML**: To avoid extraction failure:
  ```
  Please preserve the original HTML content
  ```

- **Fetch Complete Content**: For limited extracted content:
  ```
  Please fetch the complete webpage content instead of just the main content
  ```

- **Return HTML**: To get content in HTML format:
  ```
  Please return the content in HTML format
  ```

### Debugging and Authentication

#### Enabling Debug Mode

- **Dynamic Debug Activation**:
  ```
  Please enable debug mode for this fetch operation
  ```

#### Using Custom Cookies for Authentication

- **Manual Login**: To log in with credentials:
  ```
  Please run in debug mode so I can manually log in to the website
  ```

- **Interacting with Debug Browser**: In debug mode, you can log in manually after the browser opens.
