## Become an irreplaceable 10x developer in 30 seconds flat

Why learn actual skills when you can just *look* impressive instead?

Introducing **rust-stakeholder** - a CLI tool that generates absolutely meaningless but impressive-looking terminal output to convince everyone you're a coding genius without writing a single line of useful code.

> "After using rust-stakeholder, I'm no longer asked about my deadlines but rather for my insights during board meetings." - Developer who still hasn't completed their tickets from last sprint

Remember, it's not about your actual contribution to the codebase; it's about how complicated your terminal looks when the VP of Engineering walks by. Nothing says "I'm vital to this company" like 15 progress bars, cryptic error messages you seem unfazed by, and technical jargon nobody understands.

## Features that add zero value but look incredibly important

- 🖥️ **Dazzling development simulations**: Make it look like you're solving CERN-level computing problems when you're actually just refreshing Reddit.
- 🧠 **Meaningless jargon generator**: Impress with phrases like "Implemented non-euclidean topology optimization for multi-dimensional data representation" (no, it doesn't mean anything).
- 📊 **Convincing progress bars**: Nothing says "I'm working" like a progress bar slowly advancing while you're in the break room.
- 🌐 **Fake network activity**: Simulate mission-critical API requests that are actually just your computer talking to itself.
- 🚨 **Artificial crisis mode**: Generate realistic-looking alerts so people think you're heroically averting disasters.
- 👥 **Imaginary team activity**: Pretend your invisible friends are sending you important pull requests.
- 🎮 **Domain chameleon**: Switch between backend, frontend, blockchain, and 7 other domains faster than you can say "full-stack developer."

## Testimonials

> "I left rust-stakeholder running over the weekend. When I came back on Monday, I had been promoted to Principal Engineer." - Anonymous

> "No one knows what I do, and thanks to rust-stakeholder, neither do I." - Satisfied User

> "Since installing rust-stakeholder, my colleagues have stopped asking me for help because my work 'looks too advanced'." - Senior Imposter Engineer

## Tests? What tests?

Currently, this package has the same amount of test coverage as your excuses for missing deadlines - absolutely none.

Much like your actual development skills while using this tool, tests are purely theoretical at this point. But | <details><summary>blazi...</summary><p>blazingly-fast, meme, rust</p></details> | 1811 | https://github.com/giacomo-b/rust-stakeholder |

Anubis [weighs the soul of your connection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_of_souls) using a SHA-256 proof-of-work challenge to protect upstream resources from scraper bots.

## Overview

Installing and using Anubis will likely prevent your website from being indexed by some search engines. This is considered a feature, not a bug. The aggressive behavior of AI scraper bots has necessitated this approach. While Cloudflare is often sufficient for protection, Anubis is an alternative for those who cannot or do not wish to use it.

If you want to try this out, connect to [anubis.techaro.lol](https://anubis.techaro.lol).

## Support

If you encounter any issues while running Anubis, please [open an issue](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/issues/new?template=Blank+issue) and tag it with the Anubis tag. Be sure to include all relevant information for diagnosis.

For live chat support, consider joining the [Patreon](https://patreon.com/cadey) and asking in the Patron Discord in the `#anubis` channel.

4. 成功后，BotFather 会发给您一个 Bot API Token（格式类似：`000000000:ABCDEFGhijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`）
5. 请安全保存这个 Bot API Token

### 3. 选择部署方式

#### 方法一：GitHub 一键部署（推荐 ⭐）

这是最简单的部署方式，无需本地开发环境，直接通过 GitHub 仓库部署。

1. Fork 或克隆本仓库到您的 GitHub 账户
2. 登录 [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/)
3. 导航到 **Workers & Pages** 部分
4. 点击 **Create Application**
5. 选择 **Connect to Git**
6. 授权 Cloudflare 访问您的 GitHub，并选择您 fork 的仓库
7. 配置部署设置：
   - **Project name**：设置您的项目名称（例如 `open-wegram-bot`）
   - **Production branch**：选择主分支（通常是 `master`）
   - 其他设置保持默认
8. 配置环境变量：
   - 点击 **Environment Variables**
   - 添加 `PREFIX`（例如：`public`）
   - 添加 `SECRET_TOKEN`（必须包含大小写字母和数字，长度至少16位），并标记为**加密**
9. 点击 **Save and Deploy** 按钮完成部署

这种方式的优点是：当您更新 GitHub 仓库时，Cloudflare 会自动重新部署您的 Worker。

#### 方法二：Vercel 一键部署

Vercel 提供了另一种简单的部署方式，也支持从 GitHub 仓库自动部署。

1. 点击下方的"Deploy with Vercel"按钮：

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwozulong%2Fopen-wegram-bot&env=SECRET_TOKEN,PREFIX&envDescription=配置您的机器人参数&project-name=open-wegram-bot&repository-name=open-wegram-bot)

2. 按照 Vercel 的提示完成部署流程
3. 配置环境变量：
   - `PREFIX`：设置为您想要的 URL 前缀（例如 `public`）
   - `SECRET_TOKEN`：设置一个安全的令牌（必须包含大小写字母和数字，长度至少16位）
4. 完成部署后，Vercel 会提供一个域名，如 ` | <details><summary>teleg...</summary><p>telegram, telegram-bot, telegram-bots</p></details> | 646 | https://github.com/wozulong/open-wegram-bot |

We are excited to announce the release of **DAPO**, a fully open-sourced system for large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) with large language models (LLMs). DAPO stands for **D**ecoupled Clip and **D**ynamic s**A**mpling **P**olicy **O**ptimization, which is a novel algorithm designed to achieve state-of-the-art performance in LLM RL tasks.

Through this initiative, we aim to provide the research community and society with practical access to scalable reinforcement learning, fostering innovation and collaboration in this exciting field. Our system builds upon the impressive [verl](https://github.com/volcengine/verl) framework, and we extend our gratitude to the developers for their outstanding work.

## Discussions Welcomed

If you have any questions or comments regarding our paper or the DAPO system, please feel free to open issues on our GitHub repository. We welcome discussions and feedback!

## Key Results

### AIME 2024 Performance

🚀 **DAPO** achieves an impressive score of **50 points** on the AIME 2024 benchmark using the Qwen2.5-32B base model, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art (SoTA) model, DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B, while utilizing 50% fewer training steps.

### Metric Supervision during Training

1. **Length Stability and Growth**: The gradual increase in response length promotes exploration, enabling the model to learn complex reasoning behaviors, thus enhancing training stability and performance.
  
2. **Reward Score Stability**: A consistent rise in reward signals indicates that the model is effectively fitting the training distribution, ensuring a robust and stable learning process.

3. **Entropy and Mean Probability Trend**: A controlled increase in entropy, following an initial decrease, maintains a balance between exploration and exploitation, preventing overfitting and promoting sustained model performance.
